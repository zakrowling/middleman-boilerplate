# Middleman Boilerplate
A custom boilerplate installation of Middleman for new projects using HAML and SASS setup in Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS (SMACSS).

## To run:
bundle exec middleman

## To build/compile a new static version:
bundle exec middleman build

This will add a "build" folder to root that is exported in HTML/CSS.
